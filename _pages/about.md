I am a **backend developer** by career for 7 years. I have created data pipelines and apis.

I consider myself a Tech Rover and most of my learnings are by exploration.

During the exploration phase I came across many challenges that needs further more exploration and sometimes I get lost in the oceans of 
technolgies.

These posts are just few of the concise steps that I have travelled.

I hope you find my posts informative and entertaining.
